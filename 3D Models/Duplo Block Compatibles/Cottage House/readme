## Cottage House Toy - Duplo Blocks Compatible  
The custom blocks should come out close to spec if you have the same print settings. The top pegs have filleted edges to ease in building.  

The bottom design took 15 test prints to get just right, compensating for minor differences in printing. The inside features a rounded square shape to help with bridging the top section.

I’ve included a support piece to help prevent the "elephant's foot" issue. This support is easily removable but might not work if you're not using a .1 or .2 layer height. For example, a 1.5 layer height would likely make the part too close to the support, while a .3 layer height *may* work, though I haven’t tested it.  

Lastly, please review my print settings, as these will likely affect the print dimensions.
