## Anycubic Kobra Go  
**Printhead / Part-Cooler & Fan-Ducts**  
**Revision 1**  

### Setup  
- **60mm Center Radial Fan:** Heatbreak Cooler  
- **Dual 4020 Blower Fans:** Two Independent Printhead Ducts  

### Recommendations  
- Take the time to manually place supports to avoid any supports within the ductwork. 
- If your support settings are dialed in, it should work fine, but if you're using the stock setup, 
- I suggest printing this twice. The second print with the new duct will likely turn out much nicer, which is the whole point anyway, right.
- The 60mm fan should run at 100% anytime voltage is applied to the hot end or anytime the printer is powered onâ€”unless you enjoy clearing jams, of course.  
- I recommend keeping the blower fans synchronized and controlling them together.  

Blower Fan Series Wiring Instructions
For a **12V printer**, you could wire two 5V fans in series, but some fans may not appreciate the extra voltage at full power. A **24V printer** could run two 12V fans in series.  
- **Series Wiring:**  
    - Connect **positive from Fan A** to the printer mainboard.  
    - Connect **negative from Fan B** to the printer mainboard.  
    - Connect the remaining **Fan A negative** and **Fan B positive** fan wires together.
