# David Orlo 3D Printer Stuff Repository

This repository contains a variety of files, pictures, and information related to the 3D printing work I've done.

## What You Will Find Here

- **Anycubic Kobra Go**: Includes mainboard pictures, modifications, and printer-specific information.
- **Keil Tools**: Custom scripts I've written to assist with setting up new projects in Keil, particularly designed with Marlin in mind.
- **Klipper**: Features my current Anycubic Kobra Go config file. I'll also include additional files and information as I update and enhance my setup.
- **Notepad NPP UDLs**: UDLs (User Defined Languages) that I created for unique code languages, including Marlin and a hybrid PowerShell/Cisco IOS environment, which were essential for my full-time job at the time.

I plan to create instructional posts and share them under my account on Reddit, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Azyn_One/submitted/).

Additionally, I'll be uploading videos to my YouTube channel, accessible [here](https://www.youtube.com/@DavidMiOo).

Thank you for stopping by!
